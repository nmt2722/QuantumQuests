Structural Analysis can be performed by the following two ways :-

- Force Method
- Displacement Method

For using the Force Method, knowledge of ***Statical Indeterminacy*** is neccessary. Statical Indeterminacy is also know as ***Redundancy***.

**Degrees of Freedom** forms the basis for Displacement Method. It is also known as ***Kinematic Indeterminacy***
