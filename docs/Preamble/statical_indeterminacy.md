# Statical Indeterminacy
## Conditions for Equilibrium
The number of reactive components that are necessay to keep a body in equilibriyum will be equal to the number of equilibrium conditions available for that body.

For a planar structure subjected to non concurrent forces, there are three conditions of equlibirum, namely:-

- The algebraic sum of all the forces in the horizonal direction should be equal to zero.

$$\sum{H}=0$$

- The algebraic sum of all the forces in the vertical direction should be equal to zero.

$$\sum{V}=0$$

- The moment of all the forces about any point in the plane should be equal to zero.

$$\sum{M}=0$$

## Statically Determinate Structure

!!! note "Statically Determinate Structure"
    A structure in which the number of reactive components is equal to the number of available conditions of equilibrium is known as a Determinate Structure.
